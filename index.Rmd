# Preface {-}

This book is a re-coding of [Statistical Methods in Water Resources](https://pubs.usgs.gov/twri/twri4a3/) by Helsel & Hirsch. As the use of R in the hydrology community steadily grows, translating Helsel & Hirsch material into R was an opportunity we could not miss. The content herein is a direct adaptation of the source material into R and its tools.
